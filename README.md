# My Mac LLAMA App

## Carlos Mbendera did all the hard work! All of it.

## Overview

My Mac LLAMA App is a menu bar application for macOS that integrates directly into your system's top bar. 
It's an app I made for myself to easily chat with Ollama, LLAMA 3, without opening the terminal everytime.
It's designed for quick access and instant feedback, making it a convenient tool for real-time text processing.

Best of all. Everything's local.


## Features

- **Menu Bar Integration:** Runs quietly in the menu bar, allowing for constant availability without obstructing desktop space.
- **Real-Time Text Interaction:** Send text prompts and receive responses from a configured API, all within a few clicks.
- **Simple UI:** A minimalistic user interface that focuses on functionality and ease of use.

## Requirements
- Have Ollama installed and running in the background
- You can make it run in the background with `ollama serve`
- Instructions on how to download and deploy Ollama can be found here https://ollama.com

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see a brain icon in your menu bar:

- Click on the icon to open the text input field.
- Enter your prompt and either press Return or click the "Send" button to submit.
- The application interacts with the specified API and displays the response below the input field.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in XCode
3. Change the Development Team
4. Build and run the app
